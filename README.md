# JunoDocs

This is the documentation for the Juno IDE. It is created using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl)

## Contributing to the Documentation

In order to contribute to the documentation, simply modify the files in the /docs/src
folder. When committed, Travis will run Documenter.jl which will automatically
update the documentation website, meaning that no build steps are required.
