# Basic Usage

### The Command Panel

### Common Keyboard Shortcuts

Atom will need to be reloaded, either by closing and reopening it or by
running the `Window: Reload` command. At this point, you should find that
there are a bunch of new Julia commands available in Atom – type "Julia"
into the command palette to see what's available. If the `julia` command
isn't on your path already, set the Julia path in the julia-client settings panel.

Get started by going into a buffer set to Julia syntax, typing `2+2`, and pressing
<kbd>C-Enter</kbd> (where <kbd>C</kbd> stands for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, or <kdb>Cmd</kbd> on OS X).
After the client boots you should see the result pop up next to the text. You can
also work in the Atom REPL by pressing <kbd>C-J C-O</kbd> – just type in the
input box and <kbd>Shift-Enter</kbd> to evaluate.
